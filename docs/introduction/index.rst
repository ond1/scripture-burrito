Overview
########

A Bible translation project contains hundreds of files. Different tools organize them differently — the same project looks completely different on disk in Paratext, Translation Core, or a publishing pipeline: different file names, different directory layouts, different conventions. Some tools store projects as directory trees or zip files; others use GitHub repositories. Projects may also be delivered via API. When one tool passes a project to another, the receiving tool has no way to know what each file contains, what part of Scripture it covers, or what role it plays.

Scripture Burrito solves this by putting a machine-readable metadata file — the *burrito* — at the center of every project. The burrito describes every file: its format, its Scripture coverage, and its role. Tools use the burrito to exchange, load, and store projects reliably, regardless of how the project is stored.

Burritos are organized by *flavor*, which describes the kind of content the project contains.

Goals
=====

The goal of any standard is **interoperability** — independently developed tools exchanging content without custom integration work. Scripture Burrito exists to serve that goal. Claiming conformance is not the goal — a specification that lets implementations claim conformance without delivering interoperability does not serve its users.

A flavor specification is worth writing only when two or more independent implementations need to interoperate. The working group requires some implementation experience before standardizing a new flavor, because real implementations reveal requirements that are invisible on paper. Before a flavor is accepted into the standard, the working group requires a **demonstrated interoperability test with real data** between two or more independent implementations. A specification and a single implementation are not enough.

When the need for a new flavor standard is clear, the working group brings together the stakeholders — tool developers, content producers, and publishers — to write the specification collaboratively. The working group is developing more efficient processes to keep this work focused and avoid paralysis by analysis.

#. Scripture Burrito supports **data interchange** between ecosystems and serves as a **portable archive format** for translation projects, covering all stages from initial drafting through checking, publication, and revision.

#. Non-text formats such as audio and sign language are **first-class content**, not add-ons to a text translation.

#. A burrito exported from one tool can be imported into another and back without data loss.
